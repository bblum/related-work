BigTable

================
==== Praise ====
================

The system architecture description is quite clear; at no point did I feel lost
about how the SSTables were involved. It seems a little bit analogous to a
log-structured filesystem to me.

I think their evaluation section is quite good. All the benchmarks are explained
and reasoned about in detail, and the performance pitfalls are adequately
discussed.

===================
==== Criticism ====
===================

It's not clear to me what the limitations of bigtable's 2-dimensional indexing
are. The column-family thing seems to generate an ad-hoc third dimension -- why
is that not represented as an actual third dimension? and is there no mechanism
for getting additional dimensions when needed?

This paper's narrative seems to be missing a component - namely, what is it that
bigtable is improving upon? What, if anything, was google able to do with GFS
and mapreduce *before* bigtable? Or was the research challenge simply to provide
*any* relational database that works at GFS scale? The related work section
especially gives the sense that bigtable is *less* advanced, at a feature-set
level, than the state of the art, so this feels more like a tech talk than a
research contribution paper.
