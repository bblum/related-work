Worse is Better

This is some good cynical philosophy. It's much like a discussion I was having
over dinner last night, in which two friends and I talked about how PL research
systems research, and security research have (respectively) decreasingly less
"tear it down and start from scratch" motivation and increasingly more "there's
no changing people who will write and use bad software, and they collectively
have all the money, so let's help them."

I guess the major weakness of this work is 90% of the "better"s in it refer to
software-evolutionary-advantage, i.e., "characteristic of software that has the
best chance of surviving", though this isn't the same as "better for making
the people who have to work with this software happy". The document isn't a call
for programmers and researchers to work against this tension, which I would
rather have seen!
