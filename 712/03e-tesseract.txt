==== Praise ====

It's good that the paper discusses what attackers are still capable of achieving
- e.g., taking over as a master DE and disrupting performance - and how that can
be mitigated / recovered from.

The discussion in section 3.6 of why it might be better to not logically
separate two of the planes (acknowledging the tradeoff) is welcome -- until
then, I had been wondering why the planes needed to be logically separated and
whether not separating two planes could allow for better performance.

==== Criticism ====

The binary-moded security model ("network admins can choose which one they
want") worries me -- it seems like instead of being all-or-nothing with security
guarantees, there could be some sort of sliding scale of robustness, where the
network admin could choose to activate/deactivate specific security features or
tune the performance characteristics of each one (e.g., how frequently the
backup DEs poll for a compromised master).

==== Nitpicks ====

The link flapping experiment doesn't discuss how much time is needed for the
path to be recomputed. This makes me wonder if there's a particular frequency
where if the link flaps faster than that, the path cannot be recomputed in time
for performance to stay reasonable.
