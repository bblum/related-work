Ritchie74, "the UNIX paper"

==== Praise ====

I like the shell section (6), which in just a page and a half sets the mood for
the UNIX-style command line environments we still use today (e.g., encouraging
the use of chained piped processes rather than requiring programs to implement
all sorts of optional flags).

The perspective section is great. I wish more modern papers had a "perspective"
section; these days we seem to scatter perspective throughout all the other
sections.

==== Criticisms ====

I wish the "influences" (i.e. related work) section were longer. While the
paper paints a great picture of what it's like to work in the UNIX environment,
it's hard to tell just from this paper how much of that is novel, versus what
it's like to work on e.g. multics.

==== Nitpicks ====

The system's special treatment of the root directory is more special than the
system's treatment of /bin, which (sec. 6) is just in the search path by
convention of the shell.

The "null filename" refers to the current directory, but so does "."?

"If arbitrary linkes ... it would be difficult to detect when the last
connection was severed" presumably this paper is written before hard-links,
which work by refcounting? (Or are they talking about the circular refcount
problem?)

I guess the ".."-on-mounted-filesystems rule has changed since this paper (sec.
3.4).

"There is about one crash every other day ... [sometimes caused by]
inexplicable processor interrupts to random locations" I originally thought
this was them hiding the fact that they couldn't debug it before writing the
paper, but I am advised that hardware actually used to be this unreliable. My
goodness.
