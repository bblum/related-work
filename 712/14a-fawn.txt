==== Praise ====
================

The paper is organised well, and easy to follow (and easy to skip over sections
while knowing generally what you missed).

I'm not sure whether this is one of the first papers to tackle the issue of
energy-aware cluster computing, but section 2 makes it read like one. And I
would guess it's the first to pitch the "queries per joule" issue in a way
that'd sound attractive to people from industry, playing to concerns of energy
bills from datacentres, etc etc. As such section 2 is really strong.

===================
==== Criticism ====
===================

In the intro they discuss a bound on how long a key range can stay locked during
a node failure, but I don't see a corresponding experiment for that in the
evaluation section. Also I wonder what's the key range lock time for when
multiple nodes fail -- is there just more downtime, or data-loss, or...?
