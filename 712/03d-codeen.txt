Codeen (usenix 04)

==== Praise ====

I appreciate their discussion of the various different things that can go
wrong - from security abuses to the limitations of each of their different
type of heartbeat messages.

==== Criticism ====

The first figure shows that clients have to configure a specific node in their
web browser. Does this mean the client will henceforth use that node for the
rest of their traffic? It seems like it'd be better to have an initial service
where any codeen node could redirect a client, such as "here, you appear to be
geographically closest to node XYZ" -- a little more like akamai, still
without needing to be in control of the entire internet to achieve.

Either I misunderstand what codeen does at its core, or I would call it more
of a proxy farm than a content distribution network. It seems to me like the
main difference is whether subsets of the CDN's machines are dedicated to
particular websites (e.g., amazon purchases a bunch of akamai's storage,
bandwidth, etc to serve their specific content), as opposed to this paper's
strategy, where any component of the network (i.e. the proxy server one client
is connected to) can be used for connecting to any remote location.

==== Nitpicks ====

Since this paper came 6 years before the akamai paper, how much do they mean
"akamai" when they mention comparing against commercial systems? The related
work is not clear on this.
