Time, Clocks, Ordering of Events

================
==== Praise ====
================

"A system is distributed if the message transmission delay is not negligible
compared to the time between events in a single process." I like this
definition, and hadn't thought of it that way before.

The formulation of specific concepts / thoughts is very clear, even when making
complicated statements -- for example, the logical structure of the ideas makes
it easy to understand why a central scheduling algorithm for mutexes can't
satisfy bounded waiting.

Lamport does a good job of justifying, in asides, why his assumptions are valid
and what you could do in their absence.

===================
==== Criticism ====
===================

Why is it necessary to order events totally? Intuitively, it seems more useful
to leave concurrent events unrelated. It's not really clear why this enhancement
is necessary for the mutual exclusion algorithm.

==================
==== Nitpicks ====
==================

The three mutual exclusion conditions listed on page 4 are the three I know by
name as "mutual exclusion", "bounded waiting", and "progress". Was this paper
written before this started being a common idea, or after (or was it the cause
of it)?

Not clear at all what footnote 7 means.
