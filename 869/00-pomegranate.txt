Pomegranate is a parallelizing graphics pipeline that, as opposed to the
abstract pipelines we reviewed in class on wednesday, sorts many times in
between several stages of the pipeline. They also support heterogeneous networks
of processors (where some pipelines may be slower than others), and claim 87% to
99% efficiency of parallelism with a (seemingly-arbitrary) 64-pipeline maximum.
The inter-pipeline network also does loadbalancing.

Why do they claim 64 pipelines is the maximum? I saw no reason given in the
paper; is it just because parallelism-efficiency drops off sharply after that?

The architecture requires changes at both the software and hardware level, so
they additionally had to use a hardware simulator for evaluation. In general the
evaluation section is really good, analyzing the reasons for small discrepancies
in their graphs, and providing an honest comparison against a bunch of different
sort-once approaches.

In the evaluation section they remark that the March benchmark doesn't require
any ordering between cubes that don't occlude each other. Why is this remark not
vacuous? Seems like that would be true of any workload ever.
